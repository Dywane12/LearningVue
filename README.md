# LearningVue
This is a repository where I will put my testing apps while I'm learning Vue3

I am following this tutorial for now, and once I finish it I will move to another tutorial
that has longed videos and probably more in-depth/detailed things.

#### Tutorial 1 notes

Episode 1:
Nothing much happened, we initialized Vue3 with <script></script> in the <head> part of the html document
We set up a Hello World using {{ greeting }} and some javascript
We made an input that has v-model="variable-name" (in this case, 'greeting') and it updates the greetin in real time
And we made a javascript that changes the "greeting" to "Changed" after 3 seconds putting that in mounted() and using setTimeout
